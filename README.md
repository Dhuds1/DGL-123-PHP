# DGL-123-PHP
### For the PHP learning and stuff, and random rants about coffee, potentially.

## __Week 1__
> 1. Changed the Variable $name from Ivy -> 'Dawson'
> 2. Changed the Variable $name from Ivy -> 'Dawson' and added another $name and set it to 'Evelynn'
> 3. Changed the values of ['salt'], ['sugar'] and ['fat'], did it differently than they wanted, because I wanted to do it differently, added ['protein'] to the assosiative array
> 4. Added 'Licorice' to the indexed array, echoed index item [4] and [5] in separate paragraph tags
> 5. Added a key of ['protein'] and a value of 7.3 to the assosiated array, I learned that you can add keys and values after the fact. This is cool!
> 6. Added another item of 'Chocolaty' to the assosiated array inside an array, set the ['price'] to 2 and the ['quantity'] to 83
> 7. Changed the $name from Ivy -> 'Dawson', added 'Egg Gummies' to index[0] of the array
> 8. Changed the ['price'] to 3.290047393364929 and ['quantity'] of items to 211, additionally, I added a round($subtotal) __for the memes__.
> 9. Changed the $message = $prefix . ', ' . $name; -> $message = "$prefix, $name"; I never really understood the difference between the quotes until this chapter, so that's cool!
> 10. Swaped the values of ['stock'] and ['wanted'] to see how the comparison opperator worked
> 11. Swaped the values of ['stock'] and ['wanted'] to see how the logical opperators worked
> 12. Changed the $name from Ivy -> 'Dawson', changed the $greeting from 'Hello' -> 'Hi', updated the ['qty'] of candy from 5 -> 3, updated the ['price'] of candy from 5 -> 6
>
> ### Summary
> In general, most of this chapter were things I already knew, and I only learned a few things: Spaceship opperator, difference between "double quotes" and 'single quotes' and being able to expand an assosiative array after its declaration.
